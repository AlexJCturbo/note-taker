## Installation
To run the project, the user must install Node.js, and Express.js for the routes, uniqid to generate an ID for each note, and Insomnia to perform GET, POST and DELETE tests. Download Node.js from the [Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/en/), and [Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/download). Follow the instructions from the [Express.js Installing website](https://expressjs.com/en/starter/installing.html) and [uniqid npm website](https://www.npmjs.com/package/uniqid) on how to install them. Finally, create an account in [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/) to host the application.
